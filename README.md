## Title : Compare traditional neural networks with self explaining neural networks in terms of performance and interpretability

The entire project is divided into three parts.

1. Obtain baseline scores for Performance and Interpretability Metrics for the tasks of Sentiment Analysis using a RNN and Image Classification using a CNN.
2. Use a Self Explanatory Neural Network to include Interpretability into the training process and obtain scores for the Performance and Interpretability metrics.
3. Define explanations for the task of Speech Recognition and model them for a network.
