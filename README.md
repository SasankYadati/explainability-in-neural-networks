# Explainability-in-neural-networks

## Compare traditional neural networks with self explaining neural networks in terms of performance and interpretability

The entire project is divided into three parts.

1. Obtain Performance and Interpretability metrics for the tasks of Sentiment Analysis using a LSTM and Image Classification using a CNN.
2. Design Self Explaining Neural Networks for the same tasks and measure Performance and Interpretability.
3. Define explanations for the task of Speech Recognition and model them for a network.
