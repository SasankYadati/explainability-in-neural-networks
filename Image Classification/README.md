# Image Classification Task

## Performing CNN Image Classification and then adding interpretability to the model.

	1. Using CNN Architecture with a Posteriori Explanation Package.
		a.LIME and SHAP are used to perform the posteriori explanations.
	2. Using SENN to perform the same task of classification and making the interpretability inherent into the training process.
	
## Measuring Performance and Interpretability.

	1.Performance measured using Accuracy, Precision, F1 Score and Recall.
	2.Interpretability using Stability.
		- Stability is measured as the ratio of the MSE between the original explanation and the explanation of the noisy image to the MSE between the original and the noisy image.

## Datasets used : 

	1.MNIST
	2.Skin Cancer Dataset
	3.CIFAR 100
