# Sentiment Analysis on IMDB Dataset
We evaluate two architectures of comparable sizes and capacity on the task of Sentiment Analysis on IMDB dataset. The evaluation criteria are performance and interpretability,
which are discussed further below.
<i> Work in Progress </i>
## Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTMs)

### Architecture

### Performance

### Interpretability (LIME and SHAP)

## Self Explaining Neural Networks 

### Architecture

### Performance

### Interpretability (Inherent)
